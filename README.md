##  Project Overview (EarlyDetect )

Breast cancer diagnosis is challenging and requires accurate early detection to improve patient outcomes. This project develops a machine learning model to classify tumors as malignant or benign using clinical data. The dataset contains key features from breast cancer patients to train and evaluate the model. The goal is to support faster and more reliable diagnosis through automated prediction. This solution aims to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions efficiently and improving patient care.

### Error Analysis and Evaluation of Optimization Strategies

This section analyzes the performance of each neural network training instance using core classification metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, Precision, and Loss (inferred through performance behavior and regularization effects).

---

####  Instance 1 – Baseline Model  
- Setup: 1 hidden layer, 5 epochs, no regularization, no early stopping  
- Performance:  
  - Accuracy: 0.7807  
  - F1 Score: 0.8447  
  - Recall: 0.9444  
  - Precision: 0.7640  
- Analysis: The model underfits due to low capacity and short training time. High recall suggests it captures most positives, but low precision reveals many false positives. Loss remained relatively high due to lack of generalization.

---

####  Instance 2 – L2 Regularized  
- Setup: 2 layers, L2 regularization, 30 epochs, early stopping  
- Performance:  
  - Accuracy: 0.8684  
  - F1 Score: 0.8936  
  - Recall: 0.8750  
  - Precision: 0.9130  
- Analysis: L2 regularization penalized over-complex weights, helping generalization. Early stopping prevented overtraining. The model balanced all metrics well with a low loss plateau early in training.

---

####  Instance 3 – Best Performer (L1 + RMSprop)  
- Setup: 2 layers, L1 regularization, RMSprop optimizer, 30 epochs  
- Performance:  
  -Accuracy: 0.9123  
  - F1 Score: 0.9306  
  - Recall: 0.9306  
  - Precision: 0.9306  
- Analysis: L1 regularization created sparse weights, improving generalization. RMSprop's adaptive learning rate stabilized noisy updates. All metrics were optimal and loss was minimized effectively.

---

####  Instance 4 – Deep Model, No Regularization  
- Setup: 3 layers, 50 epochs, very low learning rate (0.0001), no regularization  
- Performance:  
  - Accuracy: 0.8421  
  - F1 Score: 0.8846  
  - Recall: 0.9583  
  - Precision: 0.8214  
- Analysis: The model focused heavily on positives, resulting in high recall but lower precision. The absence of regularization led to overfitting. Despite early stopping, slow convergence and high false positives raised loss.

---

###  Overall Insight

- L2 regularization (Instance 2) improved balance and stability.
- L1 + RMSprop** (Instance 3) gave best performance through sparsity and adaptive learning.
- Lack of regularization** (Instance 4) caused overfitting and reduced precision.
- Early stopping** was effective across optimized models.
- Loss behavior** correlated strongly with generalization—minimized loss aligned with stronger precision and accuracy.

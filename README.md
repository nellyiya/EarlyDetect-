## üîç Project Overview (EarlyDetect )

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women globally. Early detection greatly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project uses a public dataset to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on various cell characteristics.

Our goal was to build and compare different machine learning models and deep learning approaches, while incorporating multiple optimization techniques to improve accuracy and reliability.
